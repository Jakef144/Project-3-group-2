# Project-3: Visualization

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze employment trends in California by industry and occupation from 2020-2030. Our data sets included a Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (2020-2022), Short-Term Industry Employment Projections (2023-2025) and Long-Term Occupational Employment Projections (2020-2030).

## Visualizations and Interactions
We created interactive bar charts and bubble chart with dropdowns that allow you to filter the data by industry, county, occupation and year, to allow users to look at the employment projections in 2025 and 2030. The dashboards were combing into a Flask API for ease of use and interaction with each of the visualizations. All charts include tooltips when hovering over the data; and drop down filters for each industry, year, county, and occupation.

 - In the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages dashboard, there are two dropdown filters - one for year, and the other for county
 - The Short-Term Industry Employment Projections dashboard bar chart has hoverable and clickable tooltips that show information ont the chart and an info table to the right.
 - In the Long-Term Occupation Employment Projections dashboard, the Occupation dropdown filters the Employment Info table below, and the bar charts to the right that show base and projected employment for each.
 - Each dashboard is easy to navigate to, with tabs that allows the user to click through to each.
